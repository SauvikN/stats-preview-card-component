## My process
I first added the HTML tags to give structure to the website and so that i can properly use the CSS box model.
Then I added CSS styles using a mobile-first design and then made it desktop friendly using media queries.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
I learned to properly use the flex-box and build responsive websites that adjust with 
screen sizes.

```css
.img-container {
  background-image: url("images/image-header-mobile.jpg");
  height: 35vh;
  background-position: center;
  background-size: cover;
  background-color: hsl(277, 64%, 61%);
  background-blend-mode: multiply;
  border-radius: 10px 10px 0 0;
  order: 1;
  margin-bottom: 0;
}
```


### Continued development

I would like to further refine my flexbox skills.

### Useful resources

- [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-image) - Helped me with the background property in CSS.
